# Gridlock Game

🎮 A NumPy powered Tic Tac Toe style game that demonstrates advanced array manipulation, logical operations, and Python game logic design.

## Project Overview

Gridlock is an interactive 3x3 grid game where two players take turns marking their positions. This project showcases practical applications of NumPy arrays for game development, decision logic, and win condition validation.

## About This Project

**Course:** Exercise 4  
**Topic Covered:** NumPy and Python Logic Building  
**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate

## Project Description

Develop a Tic Tac Toe style game named Gridlock, powered by NumPy. The game simulates a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their positions. The implementation uses NumPy arrays to represent the grid, handle player moves, and check for winning conditions such as rows, columns, or diagonals. The game incorporates logic for detecting invalid moves and draws, ensuring smooth gameplay through conditionals and loops.
